    <p>
      The main components of the first transistor were a germanium semiconductor, two thin gold contacts called the emitter and collector and a metal base. Basically when a small input signal was applied to the base, it could control a larger current flowing from the emitter to the collector, amplifying the signal. It's also important to note that it was a 
      <em>point-contact</em>
       transistor. It was unstable compared to modern transistors, but it laid the groundwork for future transistors.
