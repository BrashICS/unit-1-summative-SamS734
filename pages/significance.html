      Significance in Computer Science
    </h1>

    <p id="intro">
      The invention of the first transistor was significant in computer science because it replaced vacuum tubes, the "old" technology.

    <p>
      People had been trying to find an alternative to vacuum tubes for years. Why? Well, for a whole BUNCH of reasons.
    </p>

<br>

    <ul id="slist">

      <li>
        Vacuum tubes were fragile
      </li>

<br>

      <li>
        They produced a lot of heat
      </li>

<br>

      <li>
        They consumed a lot of energy
      </li>

<br>

      <li>
        They were pretty big
      </li>

<br>

      <li>
        They were not very fast
      </li>

<br>

      <li>
        They were not efficient
      </li>

    </ul>

<br>
<br>

    <p>
      So, what made transistors so much better than vacuum tubes? 
      
<br>
<br>
      
      <em>They were literally better in every way.</em>
      
<br>
<br>

      They were less bulky, less fragile, more efficient, produced less heat, consumed less power and were faster at switching and amplifying signals. Nowadays, transistors are literally microscopic while being significantly faster than vacuum tubes and point-contact transistors combined, but that wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the first transistor. It really layed the foundation for future innovation.
